WellVision -- Independent work Spring 17

Abstract:

WellVision is a software a tool for researchers and policymakers to apply various analyses to
existing oil and gas well databases. WellVision was built as a modular, plug-and-play framework
that supports the development of analysis modules in any language. Well data is stored in a local
database and accessed through a standardized data model. Two initial modules for estimating
methane emissions were developed as the initial WellVision analyses. These analyses were used to
create emissions estimates for well data sets from West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
